# Plan: in-game tutorials

**Status**: Grilled. Decisions confirmed by the owner 2026-10-09; slices not yet planned.
Resolves the `docs/backlog.md` entry "Tutorials dropped into the player's home folder" (shape
still to be decided) and the `docs/project-status.md` note that in-game tutorials matter once
others playtest. Where they disagree with this file, this file wins.

## Goal

A new player learns the world from inside it. A short `README` in their home folder gets them
from the first prompt to `lynx`, and `lynx` takes them to `hackademy.io`, an in-world site that
teaches the world's concepts and tools chapter by chapter. The site is an ordinary machine:
it can be found, scanned, rooted and defaced like any other, and the operator restores it as
findit is restored.

## Where it starts from (facts, 2026-10-09)

- **A workstation's base tree is a pure function of its owner's identity**
  (`generation/workstationFs.ts`); the journal holds only what players changed. A file planted
  in the base tree updates with the code unless a player edited or removed it.
- **The player picks their own root password** on the intro form (`ui/screens/Intro.tsx`), so
  `su root` and `apt install lynx` on their own box cannot fail them.
- **`lynx` is not preinstalled**; `apt install lynx` (root-tier) ships it. It renders headings,
  lists, `<table>`, `<pre>` and numbered links, and submits forms.
- **`cat`, `man` and `help` exist; there is no pager.** A long file scrolls past.
- **findit.io is the precedent for a fixed site.** Its names live in
  `generation/finditNetwork.ts` (a leaf, to dodge an init cycle through `publisher`); it is
  placed among the publishers in `generation/publisher.ts`, so world DNS resolves it and the
  index lists it. It is a real one-machine network: `sshd` + nginx, root from the uncrackable
  pool, falling only when a CVE window opens on the world clock.
- **`scripts/restoreFindit.ts` is the operator's undo**, and a restore is a reboot in a
  load-bearing order: end every open session, delete the journal, write a fresh boot marker.
- **Redirection and `node` exist**: `curl … > file` saves a page, and `node x.js` runs a
  script whose output pipes and redirects like any command's.
- **Content may not add verbs** (`world-content-architecture.md` rule 2): tutorials describe
  only the shipped command surface.

## Decisions (owner-confirmed 2026-10-09)

Grilled singly:

1. **The split.** A short welcome file in the player's home folder bootstraps; the tutorials
   themselves live on an in-world website read with `lynx`. Rejected: home-folder-only (no
   links, long files scroll past, everything in a guest's reach) and web-only (needs a banner
   mechanism, and the bootstrap scrolls away).
2. **The site is attackable like every machine. No exceptions.** It can be rooted, defaced,
   bricked and read; the operator restores it as findit is restored. Rejected: an unharmable
   site served from code, and a half-measure whose pages cannot be defaced but whose box falls.
3. **Concepts and tools, practised on your own box.** Each chapter explains a part of the world
   and the tools that touch it; every example targets `localhost` or the player's own machine.
   The tutorials never chain steps into a break-in on someone else, and they describe the
   danger without warning anyone (no "you will be attacked, do this now"). Rejected: a guided
   first break-in (spoils the central discovery) and a reference-only `man` (teaches no model).

Accepted in bulk:

4. **`hackademy.io` is its own fixed one-machine network**, findit's shape: its names in a leaf
   module, placed among the publishers so DNS resolves it and findit indexes it.
5. **Its posture is findit's exactly**: `sshd` + nginx, root from the uncrackable pool, falling
   only on the world clock, no bespoke weakness. Its world-readable `access.log` shows
   newcomers' addresses to anyone with a shell there — accepted as the price of decision 2.
6. **One restore script, `scripts/restoreSite.ts <domain>`**, generalised from
   `restoreFindit.ts`, covering findit and hackademy.io — two real callers. It keeps the reboot
   order.
7. **The pages are generated files** in the box's `/var/www/html`, built from content in code
   as part of its base tree: a content update reaches the live site unless that page was
   defaced, and a restore brings the current version. HTML only within what `lynx` renders
   (headings, paragraphs, lists, `<pre>`, links).
8. **The welcome file is `/home/<username>/README`**, plain text, in the player's own home only
   (not guest's, not root's, not any NPC box). About ten lines: `help`, `man`, `ls`/`cat`,
   `su root` with the password they chose, `apt install lynx`, `lynx http://hackademy.io`. It is a
   file on the box, so a visitor can tamper with it like any other.
9. **findit.io is named only on the site**, in the web chapter — the one in-world pointer to it.
10. **In-world voice**: written as a fictional collective's wiki. No fourth wall; never the word
    "game".
11. **Chapters**, each ending in a practice on your own box and pointing at `man` for syntax:
    1. Getting around — files, users, `su`, `nano`, `apt`, `man`
    2. Your box and its network — LAN, gateway, public address, NAT forwards, `rules.v4`
    3. Looking around — `ping`, `nmap`, `-sV`, `dig`, `whois`
    4. Getting in — `ssh`, `ftp`, `scp`, `nc`; passwords with `hydra` and `john`
    5. Services, versions and CVEs — `systemctl`, `ps`, `apt upgrade`, `msfconsole`
    6. The web — nginx and apache2, `curl`, `lynx`, `gobuster`, `robots.txt`, findit
    7. Traces — `auth.log`, `kern.log`, `access.log`
    8. Wifi
    9. Databases and other services — `mysql`, `redis`, `snmp`
    10. Scripting with `node`
12. **Scripting examples are files on the site** (`curl http://hackademy.io/scripts/x.js > x.js`,
    then `node x.js`), exercising `curl`, redirection and `node`. Nothing beyond the `README` is
    planted in the home folder.
13. **No new verbs.** A test checks that every command example in the tutorials names a
    registered command, so a rename or removal fails the build instead of silently rotting a
    page. The pre-release argument-realism pass (`backlog.md`) rewrites the examples with it.
14. **Slice 1 is the walking skeleton**: the hackademy.io box, `restoreSite.ts`, the `README` and
    chapter 1 — `cat README` → `apt install lynx` → chapter 1. Later slices add chapters in
    groups. One browser run at close-out covers them all.
